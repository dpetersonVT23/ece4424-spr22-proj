## Dependencies
### Datasets
lp_loc_img_data - UCSD California license plate image dataset with license plate location labels (80:20 train:test split).<sup>1</sup>  
lp_num_img_data - UCSD California license plate image dataset with license plate number labels (80:20 train:test split).<sup>1</sup>   
custom - Virginia license plate images and video dataset with no labels (contains various distances from license plate and various numbers of license plates in a given frame)

### Packages
See requirements.txt

### Weights
Zenodo Link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6459145  
Trained YOLO model weights stored on Zenodo in a zip file due to the weight file sizes being too large for GitHub.

## How to Run
See README in yolo directory for file addition requirements from Zenodo.  

Commandline Usage:  
For a custom image/video:  
> licenseplate.py [-h] [--video VIDEO_FILENAME] [--image IMAGE_FILENAME]  

To evaluate the current software's detection accuracy, recognition accuracy, and efficiency on UCSD license plate dataset:  
> evaluate.py

### Directory Descriptions
datasets - contains UCSD and custom license plate dataset as described in Dependencies section  
detection - contains all supporting files and directories required to run the detection notebook to perform data processing and train/tune the YOLO model  
examples - source images used in GitHub README below  
literature - contains original project proposal, project midway progress report, and project final report  
notebooks - contains two notebooks used for primary development of the detection and recognition modules for the AMLPR software  
recognition - contains all supporting files and directories required to run the recognition notebook to perform data processing and tune the OCR algorithm  
yolo - contains all supporting files required to load the trained YOLO model in the licenseplate.py program
